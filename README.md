# drive-pool

## What is this ?

The ultimate goal of this project is for me to learn how to interact with public API's primarily the **google api**.  
The main feature of this project will be management of cloud files from different cloud accounts and providers.

## I will be using
- Laravel
- Postgresql
- NextJS
- Material UI (MUI) component library

## Laravel Library

- Laravel Sanctum  
For Authentication. I might upgrade this to Laravel Passport in the future.
